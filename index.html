          I am from Brazil and speak Portuguese and English.
          I have a bachelor’s degree in Economics.
          My hobbies are playing MMORPG and MOBA games like World of Warcraft and Dota 2.
          I’m also a very experienced bodyboarder and a blue belt in Brazilian Jiujitsu.

            What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).<br><br>
            My interest in IT is to become a data scientist. I’m an Economist and love data and statistics and would like to make it work together. I started my IT journey in 1992 when I began to code in Pascal and C. I’ve done some good projects to the science fair using C to calculate second-degree equations and trigonometric calculation. My goal is to finish the IT bachelor’s degree and then start a Master’s in Data Science. <br><br><br>

            Why did you choose to come to RMIT?<br><br>
            I chose RMIT because it was the better-ranked university in the Open University with an online bachelor’s degree. I looked up on google and found some excellent reviews about the university and decided to give it a go.<br><br><br>

            What do you expect to learn during your studies?<br><br>
            I expect to learn the skills that will be the foundation for my career in data science. I already have excellent knowledge of statistics. I hope to be able to create applications from scratch with the most advanced technology available.<br><br><br>

          <p>
            I found this job quite appealing because it’s a Junior position and it requires no experience. I’ll be working on creating models to help companies to make decisions based on the data collected. The skills and qualifications needed for this job should be a Ph.D. or Master’s level, what’s my goal in my IT career.
            My skills at the moment are close to nothing to apply for this job. I plan to finish the IT bachelor’s degree and then start a Mater’s in Data Science. Learn Python and SQL should be essential as they are the leading technologies applied to this field nowadays.

            I found the results of those tests interesting. Firstly, I think they are pretty precise and made me think about how I can be a valuable team member. I should be in a hardworking role to be more productive and with fewer human interactions.

        <a id="projectIdea"><h2>Project Idea</h2></a>

        <div class="row">
          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>
            The creation of a smartphone application to be a complete punter solution to help them keep tracking their bets, results,  statistics of profit/losses, the return of investment, the return of capital, and so on. The most important feature would be to find an edge on the favorite. For example, the winning rate of the favorite horse to win a race is 35,4%. A punter should find odds with the edge over the free market odds (Betfair is a free market bookmaker where the odds are matched from offer and demand). The ideal is to find an edge equal to the winning rate to have long terms profit.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
          <h3>Motivation</h3>
          <p>
            There are 6.8 million Australian regular gamblers (39% of the population), and there were 32.89 million mobile connections in 2020. It’s a big market to explore. It will help those people to manage their bets better with tools that can improve their betting experience. Instead of using excel spreadsheets to calculate and make decisions, an application is more friendly and portable.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>
            The application is a complete punter solution and would have the following features:
          </p>
          <ul class = "description">
              <li>Bet tracking: users would input their bet data like description, odds, stake, tipster, and the application would store it on a database.</li>
              <li>Statistics: the application would provide all kinds of statistics using data stored in the database, providing all types of statistics like the return of investment, the return of the capital, winning rate, and so on.</li>
              <li>Collecting data from bookmakers to build a database from sports to make statistics of winners, favorite winners, underdog winners, home winners, and away winners.</li>
              <li>Live odds and alerts when the app finds an odds that has the edge over Betfair’s odds.</li>
              <li>Share tips with friends and create a forum with information and social interaction between users.</li>
              <li>Searching for the best odds between all bookmakers comparing it online in real-time.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
          <h3>Tools and Technology</h3>
          <p>
            There is no new technology or tool to be used on this project. It only requires skills to build the application and a place to store the databases. It can be written in Kotlin for android applications and Swift for iOS applications. It only will need a smartphone to run it.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
          <h3>Skills Required</h3>
          <p>
            Developers with knowledge in Android and iOS will be essential—also, data scientists to take care of all data handling and data mining. It’s feasible to find those professionals, as they are in high demand on the market. One of the advantages is that people don’t need anything new to use the application because they already have a smartphone.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
          <h3>Outcome</h3>
          <p>
            With this application, punters will have more information about their punting habits and make better decisions. The online real-time odds finder will increase their profit in the long run, as the punters will always have the best odds to bet. The edge alert is innovative and very important because it is one more tool to increase profit in the long run. The idea is to charge a subscription fee to access the application.
